# bsnkui Vue UI Component Library

bsnkui is a Vue Component Library in alpha with the goals of being lean through shipping at <50KB for everything, tree-shakeable,
modern, and to have a good developer experience. It's also not designed to feature redundant utilities, so you can use
your favorite utility library to lay out your website.

## Design

bsnkui is designed for desktop first to enable web-app development. It aims to support mobile platforms but it is not
the primary goal of the library.
